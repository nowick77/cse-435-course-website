                    The automotive industry has been rapidly innovating autonomous vehicles, but the industry is far from
                    developing a fully hands-free driving system. Clearly defined, high quality requirements has become
                    critical for developing safe and reliable systems that function as expected. This project addresses
                    that need by defining a detailed problem space and specification framework.

                    Our project focuses on requirements engineering for a hands-free driving system. The deliverables for
                    the project include a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) detailing invariant, functional, and
                    non-functional requirements for the system; and a prototype demonstrating key features and functionality
                    of the desired system, providing stakeholders with a vision of the final product.
