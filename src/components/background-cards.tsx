                    The automotive industry is rapidly evolving toward autonomous vehicles, but the gap between current
                    technology and fully hands-free driving remains significant. Clear requirements definition is
                    critical for developing safe, reliable systems that meet regulatory standards and user expectations.
                    This project addresses that need by establishing a detailed problem space analysis and
                    specification framework.

                    This project focuses on requirements engineering for a hands-free driving system. Our deliverables
                    include a complete Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document detailing functional and
                    non-functional requirements, safety constraints, and system architecture.
                    The accompanying prototype demonstrates key capabilities and validates our requirements through
                    real-world scenarios, providing stakeholders with a concrete vision of the final product.
